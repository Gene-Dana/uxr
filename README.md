# Flutter User Experience Research (UXR)

This repo provides a space for Flutter's UXR team to collaborate with Flutter contributors and academic researchers. 

We primarily use the repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/wiki) to host public project documents and the code repository to host example code used in research.
